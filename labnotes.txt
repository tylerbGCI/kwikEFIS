Rename SDR
You can name the SDRs to let Stratux know which to use for which purpose.
First log into the Raspberry Pi using your favorite ssh client. 
The user is 'pi' and the default password is 'raspberry'.

Switch to root.
    $ sudo su -

Depending on the version of Stratux some or all of the following commands may be required to shut down the Stratux processes.
    # service stratux stop
    # screen -x stratux Ctrl-C
    # screen -x dump1090 Ctrl-C
    
Ensure only the 978 MHz SDR is plugged in.
    # rtl_eeprom -d 0 -s stratux:978
    
Unplug the 978 MHz SDR and plug in the 1090 MHz SDR.
    # rtl_eeprom -d 0 -s stratux:1090
    
Plug the 978 MHz SDR back in.
    # shutdown -r now
    
Stratux has a script to automate this process of setting the SDR Serials.

SSH into Stratux and do:
Type sudo su -
Type sdr-tool.sh
